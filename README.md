This is a collection of three data tools for you to explore modeling of risk in investing:

- **Price Simulator** (Simulating asset prices with the Monte Carlo method)
- **Risk Estimator** (Evaluating portfolio risk with the VaR metric)
- **Portfolio optimizer** (Optimizing ETF portfolio with mean-variance analysis)

Simulation code largely taken from [Python from Finance Cookbook](https://www.amazon.com/Python-Finance-Cookbook-libraries-financial/dp/1789618517)
